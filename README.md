# Python-Scripts
Doing some boring tasks using the power of python scripting

## 1- rename.py
  It changes the file names to start with their <order number> 
  for example :  
  it changes the file title from "Where Does Your Mind Reside?: Crash Course Philosophy #22" to "22 Where Does Your Mind Reside"
  so the files can be sorted in the correct order of the video files
